# Google Meet - Meeting URL Interceptor

## What it does

Listens to HTTP Responses from meet.google.com and parse the body of the response as it comes through. 
So that the meeting URL, conference number and PIN can be used inside the extension for other purposes.
Use this with other API like dyndns to redirect bit.ly or rebrandly. May be a CNAME at DynDNS?
